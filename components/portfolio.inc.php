                <p style="padding: 0 50px;">Fashion photography is the most interesting and creative part of a photography. 
                  Brands, models, stylists, magazines, online-shops - need to have a fashion photos.
                  I really like this type of photography, because throught this - I can express myself.
                  The entire life consists of small particles, formed as puzzles, forming a huge picture. 
                  I am trying to capture all the important details of each story by bringing across the atmosphere. 
                  Being tirelessly in love with creative work, bright, natural daylight, delicate and present, 
                  that touches the eyes corner from day to day, I am specialized in a pure portrait photography. 
                  It implies natural daylight, free lines, airiness, lightness and softness of tones.</p>
